# This file ensures consistent dependency installation across different environments
# and addresses the npm bug with optional dependencies:
# https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4828

# Ensure optional dependencies are installed
# Note: 'optional=false' was deprecated in npm v9+ and now means 'omit=optional'
# To include optional dependencies (platform binaries), we must not omit them
# omit=

# Use exact versions for reproducible builds
# save-exact=true

# Engine strict mode - respect the engines field in package.json
engine-strict=true

# Lockfile version 3 for better workspace support
lockfile-version=3

# Prefer offline mode for faster builds when cache is available
prefer-offline=true

# Force all @react-aria/utils to use the same version to avoid version mismatch errors
# This is needed because @heroui packages depend on older @react-aria versions
# that are incompatible with the newer versions we use directly
